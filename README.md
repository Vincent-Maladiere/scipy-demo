# Scipy Demo

Access the online Jupyter Lite ðŸ‘‰ [![lite-badge](https://jupyterlite.rtfd.io/en/latest/_static/badge.svg)](https://vincent-maladiere.github.io/scipy-demo/lab/index.html)

You don't need to install anything locally. But if you want to do so, you can download this repo and follow the instructions below.

# Work locally

The course uses Python 3 and some data analysis packages such as Numpy and plotly. To install the required libraries, we highly recommend Anaconda or miniconda or another Python distribution that includes the scientific libraries (this recommendation applies to all platforms, so for Window, Linux and Mac). when you install conda Python will be installed along with it. Type conda info in your terminal to make sure conda installed correctly.

## Requirements

```
Python >= 3.7
Scipy
Jupyter Notebook
NumPy >= 1.10
plotly
```
